= SoulSync BOT

== Description

SoulSync is a bot to automate the downloading of music from the SoulSeek network. It uses the Spotify and Slskd APIs to manage downloads.

The development is being done with SpringBoot for the backend and VueJS for the frontend, since they are the two technologies that I handle better. Although I am working on automating the deployment with docker, the file is not ready yet. If you have any questions about how to set it up, please contact me.

Note that the bot is still under development, although it is already usable. If you have any questions or collaboration, don't hesitate to contact me a traves de mi portfolio.

== Installation

====
This guide is focused on the installation on a Linux system, on other OS some steps may differ.
====

In order to run the bot correctly, you must first have an instance of Slskd running locally or on another remote machine.

In the official Slskd repository you will get all the necessary information: https://github.com/slskd/slskd

=== Install using Docker

In order to install with docker, make sure you have Docker installed on your OS (https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) and also Docker Compose (https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

If you already have Docker and Slskd up and running, we can continue:

==== Clone this repo on your machine

----
git clone https://github.com/xaviqo/SoulSyncBot.git
----

==== Move to the DOCKER directory

----
cd SoulSyncBot/DOCKER
----

==== Customize the YAML file if needed

You can adapt some points of this file to your needs, for a deeper configuration of the application, you will have to do it from the properties and yaml files of the Java API or from the control panel once the bot has started.
