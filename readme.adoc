== Description

*SoulSync* is a bot to automate the downloading of music from the SoulSeek network. It uses the link:https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api[Spotify] and link:https://github.com/slskd/slskd[Slskd] APIs to manage downloads.

The development is being done with SpringBoot for the backend and VueJS for the frontend, since they are the two technologies that I handle better. If you have any questions about how to set it up, please contact me.

*This bot is still under development*, although it is already a bit unstable. If you have any questions or would like to collaborate, don't hesitate to link:https://xavi.tech[contact me] via email or through this repository.

*üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è Share everything you download from others to keep the network alive üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è*

== Installation

====
This guide is focused on the installation on a Linux system, on other OS some steps may differ. 
====

In order to run the bot correctly, you must first have an instance of Slskd running locally or on another remote machine.

In the official Slskd repository you will get all the necessary information: https://github.com/slskd/slskd

=== Install using Docker

In order to install with docker, make sure you have Docker installed on your OS (https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) and also Docker Compose (https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

If you already have Docker and Slskd up and running, we can continue:

==== Clone this repo on your machine

----
git clone https://github.com/xaviqo/SoulSyncBot.git
----

==== Move to the DOCKER directory

----
cd SoulSyncBot/DOCKER
----

==== Customize the YAML file if needed

You can adapt some points of this file to your needs, for a deeper configuration of the application, you will have to do it from the properties and yaml files of the Java API or from the control panel once the bot has started.

- *Services*
* Database - *db*: You can change the port and authentication credentials to your preference, but you must also change them in the service configuration below (be).
* Backend - *be*: API listening port and Postgres connection data. If you modify the API listening port, you must create an .env file with the environment variable _VUE_APP_BACKEND_URL_ and the value of the selected port.
* Frontend - *fe*: Express server listening port for the frontend.
* link:https://github.com/slskd/slskd[Slskd] - *slskd*: Slskd service to which the bot will make requests (If you already have Slskd running on your machine, you can comment out this service)

==== Build and compose

Finally, we will build the docker images (we use --no-cache to ensure that we build them from scratch):
----
docker-compose build --no-cache
----

image::README/docker-build.png[]

And we will start the services:
----
docker-compose up
----


====
*Attention!* It may take several minutes to start, as it has to download all the dependencies, compile and start the services.
====

Once started, we can visit our frontend (http://localhost:7316/) where we will be able to add from the control panel, the Spotify API keys and the Slskd URL to where we will send the search and download requests.

=== Standard installation

== Configuration

=== Spotify API keys

- *Create a Spotify Developer Account*: Go to the Spotify Developer Dashboard (https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard) and sign in with your account (whether you are premium or not).

* *Create a new App*:
** Crea

/*

Here are the simple steps in English to create an app on Spotify for Developers:

    Create a Spotify Developer Account:
        Go to the Spotify Developer Dashboard (developer.spotify.com/dashboard) and sign up for a developer account if you haven't already.

    Create a New App:
        Once logged in, click on the "Create an App" button.
        Fill in the required information for your app, such as its name and description.

    Set Up Your App:
        After creating your app, you'll receive a Client ID and Client Secret. These are needed to authenticate your app with Spotify's API.

    Configure Your App:
        Specify the redirect URIs for your app. This is where Spotify will redirect users after they authorize your app.

    Add Required Scopes:
        Choose the necessary scopes for your app's functionality. Scopes determine what actions your app can perform on behalf of the user.

    Implement Authentication:
        Use the provided Client ID and Client Secret to authenticate your app when making requests to the Spotify API. You'll typically use OAuth 2.0 for this.

    Start Developing:
        With your app set up and authenticated, you can now start developing its functionality using the Spotify API.

    Test Your App:
        Test your app thoroughly to ensure it functions as expected and complies with Spotify's developer guidelines.

    Submit Your App for Review (Optional):
        If you plan to distribute your app publicly or use certain Spotify features, you may need to submit it for review.

    Go Live:
        Once your app is ready and approved (if applicable), you can make it publicly available for users to enjoy.

Remember to refer to Spotify's official documentation for detailed instructions and best practices throughout the development process.

== Features

* *File format settings* - Configure from the application panel the desired file format for your downloads (FLAC/MP3/OGG/AIFF...) 

* *Detecting Spotify playlist updates* - The bot will detect new additions to your spotify playlists and add them to the download queue

* *Full synchronization with Navidrome or similar* - With the functionality to move downloaded files, you can organize your music by playlists or artist/disc with Navidrome or similar applications. To fully automate the process you can use my link:https://github.com/xaviqo/create-m3u-by-folders-bash[Bash script that generates playlists automatically].

== Acknowledgements and links of interest

* link:https://github.com/slskd/slskd[*Slskd Repository*] - *My gratitude towards this project is absolute*. Not only because I have been using their application for a long time, but also because their API has been fundamental for the development of the bot.

== Final notes

This is the first time I have made an application of this type. I have learned a lot during the development and there are things that I would now change, as well as ideas that I have not yet fully implemented. Therefore, I plan to make a new version of the application this year, with more features that will surely be liked.

I appreciate any comments, criticism or constructive advice.
